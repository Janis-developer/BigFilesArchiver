Demo of Multi-threading application.

Create a code which zips/unzips a big file by blocks of data, using Multi-threads.

Use System.IO.Compression.GzipStream.

Format of the output archive file doesn't have to be Zip. 

In fact the output zipped file will consist of few blocks each in zip format.


Several solutions are implemeted:

BFA1 - uses only basic classes and synchronization objects for multithreading. Work is orginised in kind of rotating-chained working zippers.

BFA3 - also only basic classes are used. But workers synchronisation is put into separated class.

BFA5 - more modern async/await are used in this version.
