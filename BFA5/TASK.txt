Implement a command line tool using C# for block-by-block compressing and decompressing of files using
class System.IO.Compression.GzipStream.
During compression source file should be split by blocks of the same size, for example, block of 1MB. Each
block then should be compressed and written to the output file independently of others blocks. Application
should effectively parallel and synchronize blocks processing in multicore environment and should be able
to process files, that are larger than available RAM size.
Program code must be safe and robust in terms of exceptions. In case of exceptional situations user should
be informed by user friendly message, that allows user to fix occurred issue, for example, in case of OS
limitations.

Async version.

Use the following command line arguments:

	compressing: [progname] compress [original file name] [archive file name]

	decompressing: [progname] decompress [archive file name] [decompressing file name]

On success program should return 0, otherwise 1.
Note: format of the archive is up to solution author, and does not affects final score, for example there is
no requirement for archive file to be compatible with GZIP file format.
